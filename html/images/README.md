# HTML Images

Create a simple yet optimized gallery of images.

It should:
* use modern formats (ex: `.webp`) if supported by the browser. Otherwise it should fallback to something everybody understands (ex: `.jpg`)
* **not** load all images at once, but lazy load the ones not currently in view

PS: here's a list of image URL's in both formats for convenience:

[image_1.jpg]() & [image_1.webp]() <br/>
[image_2.jpg]() & [image_2.webp]()
<br/>
[image_3.jpg]() & [image_3.webp]()
<br/>
[image_4.jpg]() & [image_4.webp]()
<br/>
[image_5.jpg]() & [image_5.webp]()
<br/>
[image_6.jpg]() & [image_6.webp]()

PS 2: depending on when you're solving this exercise the lazy-load part might not work in every browser. 

PPPS: wondering why `WebP`? Read more about this [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp).
