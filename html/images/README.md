# HTML Images

Create a simple yet optimized gallery of images.

It should:
* use modern formats (ex: `.webp`) if supported by the browser. Otherwise it should fallback to something everybody understands (ex: `.jpg`)
* **not** load all images at once, but lazy load the ones not currently in view

PS: here's a list of image URL's in both formats for convenience:

[image_1.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_1.jpg) & [image_1.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_1.webp) <br/>
[image_2.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_2.jpg) & [image_2.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_2.webp)
<br/>
[image_3.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_3.jpg) & [image_3.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_3.webp)
<br/>
[image_4.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_4.jpg) & [image_4.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_4.webp)
<br/>
[image_5.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_5.jpg) & [image_5.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_5.webp)
<br/>
[image_6.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_6.jpg) & [image_6.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_6.webp)
<br/>
[image_7.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_7.jpg) & [image_7.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_7.webp)
<br/>
[image_8.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_8.jpg) & [image_8.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_8.webp)
<br/>
[image_9.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_9.jpg) & [image_9.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_9.webp)
<br/>
[image_10.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_10.jpg) & [image_10.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampava/practice-exercises/master/html/images/assets/image_10.webp)

PS 2: depending on when you're solving this exercise the lazy-load part might not work in every browser.
